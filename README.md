# Demand-forecasting-project
This project demonstrates how to forecast demand for products in a retail environment using time series analysis. The model uses Prophet to predict future demand for the top SKUs in the dataset. It ingests sales data, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and uses Prophet to forecast future demand with seasonality and trend components.
